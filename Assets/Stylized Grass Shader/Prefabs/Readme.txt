These are prefabs already set up with a LOD Group and a unique material, use them as you see fit!

On the Mesh Renderers shadow casting can be disabled should you wish. 

Unity terrain (Unity 2021.2+)
-----------------
The grass/detail system does not support LODs. As such these prefabs won't appear to do anything when trying to paint them.

Instead using the prefabs found in the TerrainFlowers & TerrainGrass folders. These do not have a LOD Group setup, that's the only difference.
