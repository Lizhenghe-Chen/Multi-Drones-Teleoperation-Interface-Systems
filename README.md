# FYP-Project
**At present, this project is only for display and inspiration, not for direct commercial and academic use. Some core documents are not included in repository, so it will not run correctly in Unity!**  

**The project is divided into two parts:**  
* One part is a personal self-developed attempt at four-axis UAV flight simulation, including realistic physical simulation (lift, centre, torque, camera, etc.), while accessing a wealth of control methods, such as joystick, keyboard, and subsequent flexible expansion of control methods. In addition, I have independently tried and developed flight control systems, such as PID control, which have achieved horizontal stabilisation, altitude stabilisation and manoeuvre assistance functions, with more functions to be added subsequently. Also a HUD (Head Up Display) is being developed to display the flight status of the UAV. The project is currently in the process of being developed, and the current version is 0.1.0. The project is developed using Unity3D and C#.

* The other part is a personal end of year research project to implement a remote collaborative transport system via multiple UAVs, where the cargo will be attached to each UAV via a hinge, a short description of which can be found in this report at [Here](RESEARCHPROPOSAL.pdf)
This part of the project is currently in the process of being developed,  using Unity3D, C++ and C#.
